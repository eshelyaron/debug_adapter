* TODO `disconnect` handling is a bit hacky, should be revised
* TODO `stopped` events should report a `reason` that conforms to the DAP specs.
   Currently (v0.2.1) we report the name of the *port* as the `reason`, because `dap-mode` only
   displays the `reason` field by default. This is especially important if the `reason` should be
   `expection`, in which case [[file:~/checkouts/dap-mode/dap-mode.el::when (string= "exception" reason][`dap-mode` has a special case for retrieving further info]].
* TODO Emit `output` events when applicable
* TODO Support breakpoints
* TODO Utilize the DAP Json Schema
  DAP is defined by machine-reabable Json Schema draft 4, we should utilize it to eliminate manual
  implementation of many procotol details.
